# kwtaxcalc
Kwh calculator 
This is a program designed to calculate what a standardized tax would look like using kilowatt hours in place of the tradtional gas tax. 
This is done as a way to facilitate discussion on other ways of funding infrastructure.

Ideally would like to set this up on a website to get feedback. 

Need to fix code so that it will only display 2 decimal points of data.
